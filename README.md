# ðŸŽ“ Master Seminar: Reactive Applications in Frontend Engineering Today

> Unique problems are often solved with recurring solutions in software engineering. Within this paper, we will examine a research paper by Salvaneschi et al. which compares the reappearing design pattern of the Observer and the paradigm of reactive programming, both applied on the problem domain of reactive applications. Our review will focus on various aspects: After we evaluated how the research group used design sciences and empirical research principles, we will challenge their research documentation with the FAIR research principles for computer science research projects. We will transfer the results by Salvaneschi et al. to the context of frontend engineering and answer a set of software engineering specific research questions thereafter. An outlook suggesting relevant topics for future research in the area of frontend engineering and reactive programming will conclude this paper.
