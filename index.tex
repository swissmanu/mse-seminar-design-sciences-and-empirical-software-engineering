	\section{Introduction}
	Software engineering provides patterns to solve recurring problems with proved and tested solutions \cite{159342}. However, it is rare that a given problem must always be solved with exactly \emph{one} solution. Salvaneschi et al. \cite{7827078} examine reactive programming \emph{(RP)} as an alternative to the observer pattern \cite{gamma1995design} and its impact on source code comprehensibility.

	We will examine the artifact \textbf{A1} \cite{balestra:2019:designscience:articactandcontext} \emph{On the Positive Effect of Reactive Programming on Software Comprehension: An Empirical Study} by Salvaneschi et al. \cite{7827078} and answer two sets of questions within this paper. \textbf{Q1} considers the knowledge context \cite{balestra:2019:designscience:articactandcontext} of design sciences and empirical software engineering methods, approaches and concepts:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Q1.1}: Which empirical research methods, approaches and concepts were applied?
		\item \textbf{Q1.2}: Are these research methods, approaches and concepts applied well, what could have been done better?
		\item \textbf{Q1.3}: Does the paper meet FAIR principles \cite{2019arXiv190805986H} \cite{wilkinson:2016}?
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{A1} further compares RP with an equivalent from object oriented programming \emph{(OOP)}, \textbf{Q2} therefor evaluates questions related to the software engineering context:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Q2.1}: How does the paper define RP and OOP?
		\item \textbf{Q2.2}: When should RP be considered, and when not?
		\item \textbf{Q2.3}: Which experiments should be conducted in future work?
		\item \textbf{Q2.4}: Which design alternatives exist (in a particular application context)?
	\end{itemize}

	In the following we will introduce and define important terms. Section 2 and 3 will examine \textbf{A1} and answer \textbf{Q1} and \textbf{Q2.1}. \textbf{Q2.2} through \textbf{Q2.4} will be tackled in section 4 where we discuss previous findings.

	\subsection{Design sciences and empirical software engineering}
	What are those? Why in this paper?

	\subsection{Reactive programming}
	What is it? Why?

	\subsection{Observer pattern}
	What is it? Why?

	\section{Artifact Review}
	I will assess the paper by Salvaneschi et al. \cite{7827078} in regards of the following aspects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Applied scientific methods (foundation by Kapferer \cite{kapferer:2019:empirical} and others tbd.)
		\item Study setup
		\item Challenge with FAIR Principles \cite{2019arXiv190805986H} \cite{wilkinson:2016}
	\end{itemize}



	\section{Results}
	Is the conclusion of Salvaneschi et al. \cite{7827078} reasonable and well argued?

	\section{Discussion}
	Given the results, I will put RP in context with current trends in software engineering, in particular in its subdiscipline frontend engineering.
	Ideas: RxJS, Elm, ReactJS \dots tbd.

	\section{Conclusion}
	Summarize findings, give proposal for future work on topic.
